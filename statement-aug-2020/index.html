    <h1>Statement from our marketing manager</h1>

        <p>Hi I’m Dani, </p>

        <p>I do marketing (at mates’ rates) for Tramp and I’m really worried about the future of live theatre - and if you care about theatre you should be too.</p>

        <p>I’m a marketing ‘expert’ (yep, I’m groaning too) but selling live theatre tickets during a global pandemic is one of the toughest projects I’ve worked on.</p>

        <p>I’ve led social media for organisations like Greenpeace and Surfers Against Sewage and I’ve worked with Tramp for over 5 years.</p>

        <p>I can pack out theatres during snowstorms, sell out shows from an unproven director, and win campaigns against huge companies wrecking the environment. I even saved a stray dog’s life once by raising £2000 in 2 hours for life saving surgery.</p>

        <p>But trying to get theatre lovers to return to socially-distanced outdoor shows is really really tough. This makes me really worried for the future of live theatre.</p>

        <p>Yes, it’s just one show (well, two performances), but it’s a Philip Ridley premiere in London, with some well-known actors, and great **** reviews off the back of our online monologues. It’s been called things like “Gloriously surreal,” “Touching & hilarious,” and Lyn Gardner even said: “I never want to see another monologue in my life. Then a show comes along to change my mind.” Tramp are an award-winning theatre company who’ve broken multiple box office records.</p>

        <p>Great reviews. Famous actors. An award-winning playwright. Normally this would make my job easy, especially with only two shows to sell. But it hasn’t been easy at all.</p>

        <p>Of course there are reasons, people are worried about money, worried about getting on public transport. Some are shielding. Lots of people are back home with their parents till the pandemic passes over.</p>

        <p>But if we’re suffering, all smaller theatre companies and projects are likely to suffer too. This cannot be the new normal. We have to fight to protect live theatre.</p>

        <p>We all want to see theatre that takes risks, but at the moment that can’t happen.  </p>

        <p>If it’s hard to sell a show by one of Britain’s best-known playwrights, with famous actors and great reviews, then smaller companies are going to find it even tougher.</p>

        <p>What can you do? We know money’s tight, but please come along to shows like ours if you can (we’ve added £10 ticket options for struggling actors and freelancers, students, and anyone else who needs them), and/or please RT and share links to shows on your social media channels - this is so important as it means theatre-makers can spend more money on making great shows and not advertising budget.</p>

        <p>It’s so important to support live theatre right now. Together we can protect what we love and come through the other side of the pandemic.<p>

        </p>Dani.</p>
