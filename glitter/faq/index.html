        <h2 id="what-is-bwr">What is The Beast Will Rise?</h2> 
        <p>When lockdown happened we were 2 weeks into rehearsals for The Beast of Blue Yonder, 
            the world premiere of an epic new play by Philip Ridley, which was due to have its world premiere at Southwark Playhouse on 2nd April.</p>
 
        <p>That show, like so many others, had to be postponed, but we promised people a world 
            premiere on 2nd April - and that’s just what we gave them, in the form of GATORS, 
            a monologue Philip wrote in lockdown, performed by one of the cast of The 
            Beast of Blue Yonder, Rachel Bright. </p>
 
        <p>Since then we’ve been doing one World Premiere a week, all performed by a 
            cast member in their homes, filmed on their phones, and directed (remotely)
             by Wiebke Green, the show’s director.</p>

        <p>You can <a href="/">watch the monologues</a> here.</p>
 
        <p>The new monologue will have its World Premiere as the penultimate monologue in 
            #TheBeastWillRise season.</p>
 
        <h3>Praise for The Beast Will Rise:</h3>
        <p>"I’m constantly on the edge of throwing my hands in the air &amp; saying I never 
            want to see another online monologue in my life. Then a show comes along to change 
            my mind." ~ <i>Lyn Gardner, Stagedoor</i></p>
 
        <p>"An imaginative celebration of the glittering dark." ~ <i>Aleks Sierz, The Arts Desk</i></p>

        <p>"Leaves our hairs on end." ~ <i>Arifa Akbar, The Guardian</i></p>

        <h2 id="how-do-i-enter">How do I enter?</h2>
        
 
        <h3>1 - Pick a monologue</h3>
        <p>The first thing you need to do is pick a monologue from The Beast Will Rise season.</p>
        
        <p>They’re available on the <a href="/">homepage of the Tramp website</a> and our 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyaORmJEgYP3S-pfy1TRDJw">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
        
        <p>They’re all written to be gender neutral, and can be performed by anyone.  We want your take on them.</p>
        
        <p>Pick a short section of the monologue (1-2 minutes).</p>
        
        <p>The monologues all have closed captions, so you can get the exact text by <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/100078?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">turning closed captions on</a>.</p>

        <h3>2 - Record your version</h3>
        <p>You can record the monologue on a phone or digital camera.  See our <a href="#tips">technical tips</a>.</p>

        <h3>3 - Send it to us</h3>
        <p>One you’ve recorded you need to send it to us.</p>

        <p>Go to the <a href="https://glitter-tramp.herokuapp.com">submission form</a> and submit your video.</p>
        
        <p>That’s it!!</p>
        
        <p>We’ll add closed captions (so everyone can enjoy your performance) and add your video to 
            our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyaORmJEgYP3S-pfy1TRDJw">YouTube</a> and 
                <a href="http://www.twitter.com/WeAreTramp">Twitter</a> channels, so the world can see it!</p>

                <h2 id="tips">Technical Tips</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Film it in landscape. Be close to the camera. (If you’re miles from the camera, it’s harder to pick up your brilliant acting).</li>

                    <li>It’s not a self tape.  It’s FINE to have your front room, kitchen, or bedroom in the background. It’s your set.</li>

                    <li>Record it in one shot. (You can of course do as many takes as you want, but we’d rather see one continuous shot than jump cuts between different shots)</li>

                    <li>Make sure we can see your face. If you want to do something fancy with the lighting then brilliant .. but make sure we can see your face. Otherwise it’s just radio acting!</li>

                    <li>Relish the text. Philip Ridley’s writing is a gift for actors. Relish the language and the rhythm of it.</li>

                    <li>Don’t slate it. We want to see you act, and so will the public and industry professionals watching it on Twitter. Just get straight to the acting .. don’t tell us your name, agent etc.</li>

                    <li>Please don’t add titles. Your video should just be you acting.</li>
                </ol>

<h2 id="id4">What file formats can you accept?</h2>

<p>We’d ideally like videos sent to us in MP4, .M4V or MOV format, but if your phone or camera records in another format and you can’t convert it, we’ll do our best to open it!</p>


<h2 id="id5">Who is on your industry panel?</h2>

<p><a href="/glitter/panel">These amazing people!</a></p>


<h2 id="id6">Am I eligible?</h2>
 
<p>We are trying to provide a way for emerging actors to showcase themselves.</p>
 
<p>The scheme is open to drama graduates AND other emerging actors. That means:</p>

<ul>
    
<li>Anyone who graduated from a drama school or full-time acting training in the past 2 years (or so .. we’re not going to be super strict on it)</li>

<li>Anyone who’s still in training</li>

<li>Anyone who hasn't completed full-time acting training, but has recently started out as an actor</li>

<li>Anyone else who self identifies as an early-career actor</li>
 
</ul>

<p>The opportunity is open to people of any age.</p>

<p>We welcome applications from d/Deaf, disabled, and neurodiverse actors and we’ll do our best to make the process a level playing field for you. If there’s anything we can do better, please let us know.  Please see our <a href="/access">accessibility section</a> for more details.</p>
 
<p>And, of course, we encourage applications from as diverse a range of actors as possible. If there’s ANYTHING that you think is stopping you being able to enter, or making things less than fair, please let us know and we’ll do what we can to resolve it.</p>


<h2 id="id7">What are we looking for?</h2>

<p>We’re looking for great actors and an original and engaging take on one of the monologues.

<p>It’s not a filmmaking competition.  If you want to tell part of the story visually that’s fine, but don’t worry too much if you’re not filming it on a state of the art camera, or the lighting is basic. We’re judging the acting, not anything else.


</h2>h2>Can I do more than one monologue?</h2>
 
<p>If you like.</p>
 
 
<h2 id="id8">Can I do more than one take of my monologue?</h2>
 
<p>Please just show us your best take.</p>
 
 
<h2 id="id9">I live outside the UK. Can I still enter?</h2>
 
<p>Yes. You can enter if you’re based anywhere in the world and you meet the entry requirements.
 
 
<h2 id="id10">My drama training was outside the UK. Can I still enter?</h2>
 
<p>Yes.
 
<h2 id="id11">I didn’t go to drama school. Can I still enter?</h2>
 
<p>As long as you’ve only started acting relatively recently.
 
<h2 id="id12">I’m still at drama school. Can I still enter?</h2>
 
<p>Yes.
 
<h2 id="id13">I’m still in high school / primary school / play school. Can I still enter?</h2>
 
<p>Yes.
 
<h2 id="id14">I’ve been acting for 45 years and I’ve been nominated for 21 Oscars. Can I still enter?</h2>
 
<p>No, Meryl. You can’t. This is for actors at the start of their careers. Sorry!
 
 
<h2 id="id15">Can I perform the monologue in another language?</h2>
 
<p>If you’re using spoken language, you should perform the monologues in English, as written.
 
<p>We welcome monologues from d/Deaf and hard of hearing actors performed in British Sign Language
 (as well as American Sign Language or any other sign language from an English speaking country).
 
<p>If you perform the monologue in sign language please say which sign language you’re using. This is so we can provide closed captions.
 
 
<h2 id="id16">Can I get a copy of the full script for my monologue?</h2>
 
<p><b>Short answer:</b> Yes, if you’re blind, partially sighted, or disabled. Otherwise, unfortunately not.
 
<p><b>Long answer:</b> Because Philip Ridley has written the monologues in lockdown and they haven’t been published yet, we’re not distributing them to everyone because of copyright issues.  You can use the closed captions to check the script.
 
<p>HOWEVER, if you’re blind, partially sighted or have another disability which would make doing this harder, please email <a href="mailto:access@wearetramp.com">access@wearetramp.com</a> and let us know which section of the monologue you need, and we will send you a watermarked version.
