        <h2 id="what-is-bwr">What is The Beast Will Rise?</h2> 
        <p>When lockdown happened we were 2 weeks into rehearsals for The Beast of Blue Yonder, 
            the world premiere of an epic new play by Philip Ridley, which was due to have its world premiere at Southwark Playhouse on 2nd April.</p>
 
        <p>That show, like so many others, had to be postponed, but we promised people a world 
            premiere on 2nd April - and that’s just what we gave them, in the form of GATORS, 
            a monologue Philip wrote in lockdown, performed by one of the cast of The 
            Beast of Blue Yonder, Rachel Bright. </p>
 
        <p>Since then we’ve been doing one World Premiere a week, all performed by a 
            cast member in their homes, filmed on their phones, and directed (remotely)
             by Wiebke Green, the show’s director.</p>

        <p>You can <a href="/">watch the monologues</a> here.</p>
 
        <p>The new monologue will have its World Premiere as the penultimate monologue in 
            our The Beast Will Rise season.</p>
 
        <h3>Praise for The Beast Will Rise:</h3>
        <p>"I’m constantly on the edge of throwing my hands in the air &amp; saying I never 
            want to see another online monologue in my life. Then a show comes along to change 
            my mind." ~ <i>Lyn Gardner, Stagedoor</i></p>
 
        <p>"An imaginative celebration of the glittering dark." ~ <i>Aleks Sierz, The Arts Desk</i></p>

        <p>"Leaves our hairs on end." ~ <i>Arifa Akbar, The Guardian</i></p>

        <h2 id="how-do-i-enter">How do I enter?</h2>
        
 
        <h3>1 - Pick a monologue</h3>
        <p>The first thing you need to do is pick a monologue from The Beast Will Rise season.</p>
        
        <p>They’re available on the <a href="/">homepage of the Tramp website</a> and our 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyaORmJEgYP3S-pfy1TRDJw">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
        
        <p>They’re all written to be gender neutral, and can be performed by anyone.  We want your take on them.</p>
        
        <p>Pick a short section of the monologue (1-2 minutes).</p>
        
        <p>The monologues all have closed captions, so you can get the exact text by <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/100078?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">turning closed captions on</a>.</p>

        <h3>2 - Record your version</h3>
        <p>You can record the monologue on a phone or digital camera.  See our <a href="#tips">technical tips</a>.</p>

        <h3>3 - Send it to us</h3>
        <p>One you’ve recorded you need to send it to us.</p>

        <p>Go to the <a href="https://glitter-tramp.herokuapp.com">submission form</a> and submit your video.</p>
        
        <p>That’s it!!</p>
        
        <p>We’ll add closed captions (so everyone can enjoy your performance) and add your video to 
            our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyaORmJEgYP3S-pfy1TRDJw">YouTube</a> and 
                <a href="http://www.twitter.com/WeAreTramp">Twitter</a> channels, so the world can see it!</p>

        <h2 id="tips">Technical Tips</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Film it in landscape. Be close to the camera. (If you’re miles from the camera, it’s harder to pick up your brilliant acting).</li>

                    <li>It’s not a self tape.  It’s FINE to have your front room, kitchen, or bedroom in the background. It’s your set.</li>

                    <li>Record it in one shot. (You can of course do as many takes as you want, but we’d rather see one continuous shot than jump cuts between different shots)</li>

                    <li>Make sure we can see your face. If you want to do something fancy with the lighting then brilliant .. but make sure we can see your face. Otherwise it’s just radio acting!</li>

                    <li>Relish the text. Philip Ridley’s writing is a gift for actors. Relish the language and the rhythm of it.</li>

                    <li>Don’t slate it. We want to see you act, and so will the public and industry professionals watching it on Twitter. Just get straight to the acting .. don’t tell us your name, agent etc.</li>

                    <li>Please don’t add titles. Your video should just be you acting.</li>
                </ol>


                <h2 id="what-are-we-looking-for">What are we looking for?</h2>

                <p>We’re looking for great actors and an original and engaging take on one of the monologues.</p>
                
                <p>It’s not a filmmaking competition.  If you want to tell part of the story visually that’s 
                    fine, but don’t worry too much if you’re not filming it on a state of the art camera, or 
                    the lighting is basic. We’re judging the acting, not anything else.</p>

<h2 id="file-formats">What file formats can you accept?</h2>

<p>We’d ideally like videos sent to us in MP4, .M4V or MOV format, but if your phone
     or camera records in another format and you can’t convert it, we’ll do our best to open it!</p>


<h2 id="eligibility">Am I eligible?</h2>
 
<p>We are trying to provide a way for emerging actors to showcase themselves.</p>
 
<p>The scheme is actors joining the industry at this uniquely difficult time. That means:</p>

<ul>
    
    <li>Anyone graduating from a drama school or full-time acting training in 2020.</li>

    <li>Anyone else coming into the industry at this uniquely difficult time.</li>
 
</ul>

<p>The opportunity is open to people of any age.</p>

<p>We welcome applications from d/Deaf, disabled, and neurodiverse actors and 
    we’ll do our best to make the process a level playing field for you. 
    If there’s anything we can do better, please let us know.  
    Please see our <a href="/glitter/access">accessibility section</a> for more details.</p>
 
<p>And, of course, we encourage applications from as diverse a range of 
    actors as possible. If there’s ANYTHING that you think is stopping you being able to enter, 
    or making things less than fair, please let us know and we’ll do what we can to resolve it.</p>

<p>The competition is open to actors aged 16 or over who are joining the industry this year.</p>

<h2 id="special-circumstances">I don't quite meet the criteria but my circumstances are special. Can I still apply?</h2>
 
<p>We know everyone's circumstances are different. If you don't quite meet the criteria, but you think you should 
    be able to apply anyway, then please get in touch and we'll do our best.</p>
 
<h2 id="experience">I’ve been acting for 45 years and I’ve been nominated for 21 Oscars. Can I still enter?</h2>
 
<p>No, Meryl. You can’t. This is for actors at the start of their careers. Sorry!</p>
 
<h2 id="language">Can I perform the monologue in another language?</h2>
 
<p>If you’re using spoken language, you should perform the monologues in English, as written.</p>

<h2 id="sign">Can I perform the monologue in sign language?</h2>
 
<p>We welcome monologues from d/Deaf and hard of hearing actors performed in BSL
 (as well as ASL or any other sign languages such as Auslan and NZSL).</p>
 
<h2 id="script">Can I get a copy of the full script for my monologue?</h2>
 
<p><b>Short answer:</b> Yes, if you’re blind, partially sighted, or disabled. 
    Otherwise, unfortunately not.</p>
 
<p><b>Long answer:</b> Because Philip Ridley has written the monologues in lockdown and they 
    haven’t been published yet, we’re not distributing them to everyone because of copyright issues.  
    You can use the closed captions to check the script.</p>
 
    <p>HOWEVER, we know that won't work for everyone, so if you’re blind, 
        partially sighted or have another disability which would make doing this harder, 
        please email <a href="mailto:access@wearetramp.com" aria-label="Access at we are tramp">access@wearetramp.com</a> and let us 
        know which section of the monologue you need, and we will send you a watermarked version.</p>


<h2 id="winner">How will you pick the winner?</h2>

<p>The competition will take place over 3 weeks.</p>

<h3>Open entries - Until 1pm Monday 22rd June 2020</h3>

<p>Anyone can submit a monologue.  We’ll look at them all and pick our weekly favourites.</p>

<h3>22rd - 28th June 2020</h3>

<p>Our industry panel will then help us create a shortlist of actors, before selecting a winner and runners up.</p>

<h3>Winner announced - Monday 29th June 2020</h3>

<p>We’ll announce the winner, finalists, and the full list of shortlisted actors.</p>

<p>Philip Ridley will send the winner the world premiere monologue, and will speak 
to them on the phone or vie email to answer any questions they have about it.</p>

<p>They will then then be directed by Wiebke Green, before recording their version of the monologue.</p>

<p>The monologue 
    will receive its world premiere on our website and YouTube channel at 7pm on 4th July.</p>
