  		<h1>Glitter in the Dark</h1>
  		<p>2020 is a tough year to be an actor, and an even tougher time 
              to start your acting career.</p>
 
        <p>So we wanted to shine some light on the glittering talent who are starting their 
            careers while theatres are dark - and to provide them with a chance to showcase themselves.
             
        <p>We're giving one 2020 graduate, or other actor coming into the industry at this difficult time, the chance to star in the <b>World Premiere of a brand new 
            Philip Ridley monologue</b>, which will form part of our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hashtag/TheBeastWillRise">The Beast Will Rise</a> season.</p>

        <p>You'll star alongside actors like Rachel Bright <span aria-label="from Eastenders">(Eastenders)</span>, Unique Spencer <span aria-label="from Top Boy">(Top Boy)</span>, Mirren Mack <span aria-label="from BBC's The Nest and Netflix's Sex Education">(The Nest, Sex Education)</span>, Steve Furst <span aria-label="from Matilda, Saint Trinians, and Little Britain">(Matilda, St Trinians, Little Britain)</span>, Lucy Gape <span aria-label="from Hollyoaks">(Hollyaoks)</span>, and Charlie Quirke <span aria-label="from Birds of a Feather">(Birds of a Feather)</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Here's a taster of the monologues so far..</p>
