  		<h1>Glitter in the Dark</h1>
  		<p>2020 is a tough year to be an actor, and an even tougher time 
              to start your acting career.</p>
 
        <p>So we wanted to shine some light on the glittering talent who are starting their 
            careers while theatres are dark - and to provide them with a chance to showcase themselves.
             
        <p>We're giving one 2020 graduate the chance to star in the <b>World Premiere of a brand new 
            Philip Ridley monologue</b>, which will form part of our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hashtag/TheBeastWillRise">The Beast Will Rise</a> season.</p>

        <p>The Beast Will Rise has had an incredible critical response. Lyn Gardner, writing for Stagedoor, said: "I’m constantly on the edge of throwing my hands in the air & saying I never want to see another online monologue in my life. Then a show comes along to change my mind."</p>
        
        <p>Aleks Sierz in The Arts Desk called them "An imaginative celebration of the glittering dark," while The Guardian said they "Leave our hairs on end."</p>
        
        <p>Here's a taster of the monologues so far..</p>
