  		<h1>Accessibility</h1>
          <p>There's a huge lack of diversity in our industry, so we'd like to use our platform 
            to give actors a fair and accessible opportunity to showcase their skills.</p>
            
          <p>We're encouraging entries from d/Deaf, disabled, and neurodiverse actors, and we’ve tried 
            to think of ways to level the playing field.</p>
           
          <p>If you’re d/Deaf or hard of hearing, we welcome monologues perfromed in BSL, ASL, 
            or another sign language.</p>
 
          <p>We’re asking everyone to send us their videos, so we can put closed captions on them and 
            put them up on YouTube so everyone can enjoy them. (We’ll do this as soon as we can manage, 
            but we’re a small team so there may be a delay) </p>
           
          <p>If you’re blind, partially sighted, or have another disability which would make using the 
            closed captions to get the script of the monologues harder, you can email us 
            (<a href="mailto:access@wearetramp.com" aria-label="Acces at we are tramp">access@wearetramp.com</a>) and we’ll send you a 
            watermarked version of the script.</p>
           
          <p>We’ve tried to make the instructions clear, and unambiguous for neurodiverse people.</p>
           
          <p>If there’s ANYTHING we can do to make things easier, then please let us know and we’ll do our 
            best to help.</p>
          
          <p>We've made sure our panel includes d/Deaf, disabled, and neurodiverse industry professionals,
             including people who are BSL native.</p>
          
          <h2>Can I get a copy of the full script for my monologue?</h2>

          <p><b>Short answer:</b> Yes, if you’re blind, partially sighted, or your disability means you 
            need one.</p>
           
          <p><b>Long answer: </b>We're encouraging most people to use the closed captions to check the 
            script.  Because Philip Ridley has written the monologues in lockdown and they haven’t been 
            published yet, we’re not distributing them to everyone because of copyright issues.  </p>
           
          <p>HOWEVER, we know that won't work for everyone, so if you’re blind, partially sighted or have 
            another disability which would make doing this harder, please email 
            <a href="mailto:access@wearetramp.com" aria-label="Acces at we are tramp">access@wearetramp.com</a> and let us know which section 
            of the monologue you need, and we will send you a watermarked version.</p>
