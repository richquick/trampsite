  		<h1>Accessibility</h1>
          <p>We encourage entries from d/Deaf, disabled, and neurodiverse actors.  We’ve tried to think of ways to level the playing field.
           
          <p>If you’re d/Deaf or hard of hearing, and you’d like to perform a monologue in BSL, or another sign language, you’re welcome to.
           
          <p>We’re asking everyone to send us their videos, so we can put closed captions on them and put them up on YouTube so everyone can enjoy them. (We’ll do this as soon as we can manage, but we’re a small team so there may be a delay) 
           
          <p>If you’re blind, partially sighted, or have another disability which would make using the closed captions to get the script of the monologues harder, you can email us (glitteringaccess@wearetramp.com) and we’ll send you a watermarked version of the script.
           
          <p>We’ve tried to make the instructions clear, and unambiguous for neurodiverse people.
           
          <p>If there’s ANYTHING we can do to make things easier, then please let us know and we’ll do our best to help.
          

          <h2>Can I get a copy of the full script for my monologue?</h2>

          <p><b>Short answer:</b> Yes, if you’re blind, partially sighted, or your disability means you need one.
           
          <p><b>Long answer: </b>We're encouraging most people to use the closed captions to check the script.  Because Philip Ridley has written the monologues in lockdown and they haven’t been published yet, we’re not distributing them to everyone because of copyright issues.  
           
          <p>HOWEVER, we know that won't work for everyone, so if you’re blind, partially sighted or have another disability which would make doing this harder, please email <a href="mailto:access@wearetramp.com">access@wearetramp.com</a> and let us know which section of the monologue you need, and we will send you a watermarked version.
